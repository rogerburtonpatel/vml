Here are some scientists that I know (or know of) in Asia.
They are roughly in order of goodness of fit, with the most
interesting possibilities first.


Olivier Danvy, Yale-NUS, Singapore
----------------------------------
Olivier is an absolutely brilliant theoretician and a scientist of impeccable taste.  He is best known for exploring and illuminating relationships between operational semantics and abstract machines.  He is also a world expert on partial evaluation and on continuations.  And he has been an excellent mentor to students.


Jacques Garrigue, Nagoya University, Japan
------------------------------------------
Jacques works on lambda calculus and has also contributed a number of interesting extensions to or ideas for OCaml.  He takes software seriously.  You may have met him at ICFP.


Eijiro Sumii, Tohoku University, Japan
--------------------------------------
Eijiro is primarily a proof guy, but he also gets involved in software from time to time.  He is the creator of MinCaml, a remarkable undergraduate compiler project.  MinCaml was what gave me the idea to use K-normal form instead of A-normal form.  Eijiro's web page is not very informative, so his DBLP page might be useful: https://dblp.org/pid/09/6659.html


Sukyoung Ryu, KAIST, Korea
--------------------------
Sukyoung is primarily about static analysis.  She and her students devise interesting analyses, build tools, and apply them to real code bases.  She was my postdoc, and she's great.  But she may be very busy.


Michael D. Adams, NUS, Singapore
--------------------------------
Michael has been all over the world and has only recently landed in Singapore.  He is very junior to everyone else on this list, which may make him more open to an unusual opportunity.  He has done quite a few interesting things, including work on GHC, but I know him best from a terrific series of papers on parsing.  Michael is very interested in software and is always engaging to talk to.


Martin Henz, NUS, Singapore
---------------------------
I know Martin only because of his work on the JavaScript edition of the famous Scheme book, _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.  Martin has been hard at work trying to reinvent the teaching of introductory programming.  You can see more on his web page and at the site https://sourceacademy.org that he and his colleagues have been developing.


Atsushi Ohori, Tohoku University, Japan
---------------------------------------
I know Ohori only by reputation.  He has done really interesting work on record polymorphism, although that is deep in the past.  However, I believe he is still working on SML#, an interesting set of extensions to SML.   Ohori is very senior, and I'm not sure how well he would work with someone fresh out of undergrad.
