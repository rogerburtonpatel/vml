# vml
This repository contains the source for $\vminus$ and $\pplus$, a subset of Verse and a pattern-based language.


The code is the implementation component of *An Alternative to Pattern Matching,
Inspired by Verse*, my undergraduate senior thesis with Norman Ramsey and Milod
Kazerounian. The repository also contains the source for the paper. The full paper can be found [here](rogerburtonpatel.github.io/fullpaper.pdf).
