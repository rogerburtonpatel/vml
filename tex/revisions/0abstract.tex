\title{An Alternative to Pattern Matching, Inspired by Verse}

\begin{document}


\begin{abstract}
    Pattern matching % S
    appeals % V
    to functional programmers for its expressiveness and good cost model, 
    but 
    it % S
    fails to express % V
    certain computations without verbosity. Verbosity % S 
    can be reduced % V
    by using extended forms of pattern matching,
    but extensions % (S = the problem)
    are % V
    not standardized, and the most desirable combination of extensions cannot be
    found in any one popular programming language. Alternatively to pattern
    matching, computations can be expressed succinctly by using equations, as
    has been demonstrated by the Verse programming language. But such
    computations may have time and space costs that can be hard to predict. 
    % But Verse's cost model % S-sub
    % is % V-sub
    % a challenge because of backtracking and multiple
    % results. 
    As a compromise, 
    I % S
    ~propose % V
     a 
    new language,~\VMinus, % object 
    which~uses equations in a limited way that makes time and space costs easy
    to predict. 
    % to succinctly express computation while
    % enjoying a friendlier cost model by prohibiting backtracking and multiple
    % results. 
    \VMinus~ % S 
    expresses % V
    computations as succinctly as pattern matching with popular extensions in
    comparative examples, and just like pattern matching, it % S
    can be compiled % V 
    to a decision tree. 
    
    An implementation of~\VMinus and its compiler can be found
    at~\url{https://github.com/rogerburtonpatel/vml}.
    % Question: implied that I've implemented D here, or not? 
    %%%%%%% Old, with "I show":
    % I % S
    % ~show % V
    %  that~\VMinus's equations capture the desirable properties of
    % pattern matching with popular extensions, 
    % and I % S-sub
    % ~also
    %  show % V 
    % that~\VMinus~can be compiled to a decision tree and therefore has
    % the same desirable cost model as pattern matching. Finally, 
    % I % S 
    % ~have % V 
    % implemented~\VMinus in Standard ML, alongside an algorithm for compiling it
    % to a decision tree.
