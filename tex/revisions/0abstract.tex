\title{An Alternative to Pattern Matching, Inspired by Verse}

\begin{document}


\begin{abstract}
    Pattern matching appeals to functional programmers for its expressiveness
    and good cost model, but pattern matching primitives can only express
    certain computations verbosely. The problem can be addressed by extensions,
    but these are not standardized, and no single popular programming language
    contains them all. By contrast, equations in the Verse programming language
    are both expressive and succinct, with no obvious need for extensions, but
    Verse's cost model is a challenge because of backtracking and multiple
    results. As a compromise, I~propose a new language, \VMinus, which~uses
    Verse's equations to succinctly express computation while enjoying a
    friendlier cost model by prohibiting backtracking and multiple results.
    I~show that \VMinus's equations capture the desirable properties of pattern
    matching with popular extensions, and I~also show that \VMinus~can be
    compiled to a decision tree and therefore has the same desirable cost model
    as pattern matching. Finally, I~have implemented \VMinus in Standard ML,
    alongside an algorithm for compiling it to a decision tree.
