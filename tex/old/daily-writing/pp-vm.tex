    \it{WILL BE REVISED.}
  Pattern matching is nice and has an appealing cost model, but people keep
  extending it to make it more expressive. Verse [cite-Verse] looks very simple
  and is surprisingly expressive, but the cost model is a challenge. Why not
  look for a compromise? We introduce two small functional langauges that
  attempt to address the limitations of pattern matching in popular functional
  languages.

\section{Introduction}
Pattern matching is a well-established and researched construct in functional
programming langauges [cite, appeal to authority]. It shines in its ability to
break down constructed data implicity, which is often much preferred to using
explict deconstructors like Scheme's \tt{car} and \tt{cdr}. But when deciding to
perform a terminal computation based on prior checks that don't involve a single
value matching on a pattern, pattern matching struggles to retain its brevity.
Consider the following algorithm on an abstract type~\tt{FiniteMap}, involving a
lookup function. This examples is a modificaiton of one borrowed from SPJ
proposal [cite]. 

\begin{center}
\tt{lookup :: FiniteMap -> Int -> Maybe Int}
\end{center}

"The lookup returns \tt{Nothing} if the supplied key is not in the domain of the
mapping, and (\tt{Just v}) otherwise, where v is the value that the key maps to.
Now consider the following definition:"

\begin{verbatim}
    clunky env varl var2 | ok1 && 0k2 = val1 + val2 
                         | otherwise = var1 + var2 
    where m1 = lookup env var1 
          m2 = lookup env var2
          ok1 = isJust m1 
          ok2 = isJust m2 
          Just val1 = m1 
          Just val2 = m2    
\end{verbatim}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Given two ints, look the first up in an environment which maps \tt{Int -> Maybe Int}.
%     \item If the result of the first lookup is a \tt{Maybe Int val1}, look up the second name. 
%     \item If the result of the second lookup is a \tt{Maybe Int val2}, return the sum of \tt{val1} and \tt{val2}. 
%     \item If any step fails, return the sum of the inputs. 
% \end{enumerate}

The authors show how explicit pattern matching with \tt{case} may mitigate the
verbosity of this problem:

\begin{verbatim}
    clunky env var1 var2 = 
      case lookup env var1 of 
        Nothing -> fail 
        Just val1 -> 
          case lookup env var2 of 
            Nothing -> fail 
            Just val2 -> val1 + val2
    where 
        fail = var1 + var2
\end{verbatim}

They say: 

"This is a bit shorter, but hardly better. Worse, if this was just one equation
of clunky, with others that follow, then the thing would not work at all. " 

The authors' suggested mitigation is pattern gaurds, which lead to the following
solution: 
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
    clunky env var2 var2    
    | Just vall <- lookup env var1
    , Just val2 <- lookup env var2
    = val1 + val2
\end{verbatim}
\it{... other equations for clunky}
\end{center}    

\it{This is obviously better. But now consider something where you need 
or-patterns; this fails. }

We make a contribution to this problem in the form of two small functional
languages. One, which we call {\PPlus}, is an attempt to unify extensions to
pattern matching under a single, flexible language. The other, which we call
{\VMinus}, takes inspiration from Verse and sidesteps the general structure of
the \tt{case} expression entirely, opting to take a more equation-based approach
in its decision making. We show that {\PPlus} and {\VMinus} have all the
expressiveness of pattern matching with no additional significant runtime
overhead, and we propose a form of writing Verse code that could lead to
efficient compilation based on our heuristics. 

% This is obviously better. But consider a new step to the algorithm, 
% given the following function signature: 

% \begin{center}
%     \tt{fileHandleLookup :: Int -> File}
% \end{center}

% where 

% \begin{center}
%     \tt{data File = Readable Int | }
% \end{center}

% (5) 

    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item If a list is non-empty, take its first element. 
    %     \item If that element is an even integer, take its SHA256 hash. 
    %     \item If the last digit of the hash is 0, return SOME of the hash. 
    %     \item If any step fails, return NONE. 
    % \end{enumerate}
    
    % The algorithm is implemented with the following Standard ML code: 
    
    % \begin{lstlisting}
    % case input 
    %     of []      => NONE 
    %        | x::xs => if even x 
    %                   then let val hash = sha256 x 
    %                         in case last_digit hash 
    %                              of 0 => hash 
    %                               | _ => NONE 
    %                         end 
    %                    else NONE 
    % \end{lstlisting}
    
% \begin{lstlisting}
% case input 
%     of []      => NONE 
%        | x::xs => if even x 
%                   then let val hash = sha256 x 
%                         in case last_digit hash 
%                              of 0 => hash 
%                               | _ => NONE 
%                         end 
%                    else NONE 
% \end{lstlisting}

matching is popular and well-established, but there are situations in which it
is clunky, and where Verse may shine.}

\section{Our languages, Informally}

We begin by informally introducing two small functional programming languages to
address the issue of inflexibility of patterns.

{\PPlus} models standard pattern matching with common extensions. {\VMinus}
models Verse without features that lead to unpredictable costs (backtracking and
multiple results) [cite-Verse]. 

To aid proofs of efficiency, we also introduce a third langauge, {\D}. {\D} is a
language of decision trees to which both {\PPlus} and {\VMinus} can be
translated. Targets of translation are efficient in the standard technical
sense: no value is ever scrutinized more than once (Maranget 2008).

To facilitate comparisons and proofs, the languages are each a subset of a
single unifying language(\cref{fig:U}). Asterisks (${}^{*}$) indicate components
of this unifying language which belong to the sub-languages. 

% The keen reader will notice that our syntax includes a forms for decision trees,
% which we have not yet discussed. Decision trees will be crucial in proving
% properties of efficiency of our languages, and will we be discussed in full in a
% later section.

Most syntactic categories in \U are present in all of its subsets: Values, Value
Constructors, Definition Forms, and most forms of expression are shared. Indeed,
the sub-langauge, like in Verse, is just the the lambda calculus with a few
extended syntactic categories (this time favoring value constructors over
tuples). Like in Verse, every Lambda Calculus program is a valid \U program. 

On top of this core, three languages are defined as subsets of \U. {\PPlus} is
the subset of~\U including Patterns and the $\mathit{case}\; \expr\;
\bracketed{p \rightarrow \expr}$ form of case expression. {\VMinus} is the
subset of \U including Guarded Expressions and \it{if-fi}. Finally, {\D} is the
subset of \U that includes decision tree syntax, including the reduced case
expression, $\mathit{case}\; x\; \mathit{of}\; \bracketed{\vert\;
K\bracketed{x}\; \mathit{=>}\; \dt} [\vert\; x\; \mathit{=>} \dt]$.
Importantly, the three are mutually exclusive with respect to exactly these
extensions; all subsets share the sub-langauge and no subset has more than one
of the expanded \it{case}, \it{if-fi}, or the decision tree syntactic
categories. 

% {\PPlus} provides or-patterns, side-conditions, and pattern guards, whose
% combination does not appear in Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML, or any other major
% functional language.

% interesting thoughts: 

% Having a strategem for verse to decision tree is analagous to tail recursion. 
% You have to write your code in a way that allows the optimization. 


% Pattern matching is a well-established paradigm within functional languages, and
% """has been the subject of significant discourse.""" \it{Appeal to authority here.}

% Without pattern matching, it can be tiresome to deconstruct data using manual 
% accessor functions. Consider the following Standard ML code: 
% \smllst

% \begin{lstlisting}
% val rec len = fn ys => 
%     if null ys 
%     then 0 
%     else let xs = tl ys 
%          in len xs 
%          end 
% \end{lstlisting}
% \it{An implementation of List.len in Standard ML that does not use pattern 
%     matching.}

% Manual checking and deconstruction, with built-in functions like \tt{null} and
% \tt{tl}, can be both error-prone (\bf{say more on this?}) and verbose. Most
% functional programmers likely prefer the follwing implementation of \tt{len}:

% \begin{lstlisting}
%     val rec len = fn ys => 
%         case ys 
%           of [] => 0
%            | _::xs => 1 + len xs
%     \end{lstlisting}

% \it{An equivalent implementation that uses pattern matching.}

% Indeed, pattern matching is quite appealing when deconstructing data, especially 
% data that may be represented with an algebraic data type, is the primary programming problem: 



% \begin{lstlisting}
% val len = \ys. case ys 
%                  of [] -> 0
%                   | _::xs -> 1 + len xs
% \end{lstlisting}


% Figure 1 illustrates an example in which pattern matching is an elegant solution
% to a problem (compare to equivalent Standard ML code that manually deconstructs
% a list:)


% Most functional programmers likely prefer the first example 

% However, language designers continue to extend pattern matching 

% \section{Pattern Matching as it is Now}
% \it{Pattern matching} is defined as "checking and locating of specific sequences
% of data of some pattern among raw data or a sequence of tokens." We will return
% to the notion of "checking" often in this paper: pattern matching answers the
% question "when I'm checking to see if a piece of data (called a \it{scrutinee})
% is of the same form as a certain pattern, does that match succeed or fail?"

% \it{Example}.

% In addition to this checking and locating, pattern matching serves as
% \it{assignment}: it can bind fresh variables based on the form of data and use
% those bindings in subsequent expressions. 

% \it{Example}.

% Here, "checking" means "do the data match what I expect them to." Because
% pattern matching is inherently built to match a scrutinee (pure data) with a
% pattern, pattern matching is quite expressive in these cases. 

% Because of this, most modern functional languages, especially \it{data
% dependency languages} like Haskell or ML, \it{(is this right?)} employ pattern
% matching as their main way to deconstruct data (citation?). 

% We here explore pattern matching through the lens of {\PPlus}, an invented
% language that has pattern matching along with several of its popular extensions.
% (The examples above are written in {\PPlus}.) 
% \subsection{Strengths}

% - "Checking" and assignment- nice! No car, cdr 

% - Nested patterns - powerful 

% - Literal patterns let you mix names and values 

% \subsection{Weaknesses and Proposed Mitigations}

% We return to the concept of unifying "checking" with assignment, i.e. "match if
% the data take this form, and give them names." Pattern matching succeeds here
% when checking means "is the form of data the way I expect"; in fact, as we know,
% assignment in general \it{is} pattern matching (figure/example?). But when
% checking means "does this computation succeed" or "does this binding conflict
% with a prior binding," pattern matching is at a loss, where Verse succeeds. 

% Example: 


% Pattern matching's extensions get closer to unifying "checking" and binding.
% Here, Verse enjoys a different suite of advantages. 

% First, its "or" operation (`one` with `choice`) allows for more than patterns to
% appear as a top-level "choose this or that" construct in a match sequence; you
% can also include arbitrary expressions. You can't do this in pattern matching's
% version, which is an or-pattern. Simply put, saying "does this pattern match or
% is this expression true" is easy in Verse and clunky if you use patterns. I'll
% show examples at our meeting. 

% Second, Verse can express operations out of order, letting important checks
% appear higher up even if they are executed later. This helps program legibility.
% Again, I have examples from the chapter I wrote today. 

% Third, in a pattern-match clause, the initial data must still match an initial
% pattern in order to enter a guard; in Verse there is no restriction. This is
% minor, because you could simply match the data to a variable, and then enter a
% guard-- but again, all of these advantages are in elegance and brevity, and
% elegant that solution is not. 

% Finally, mingling pattern guards with other extensions to pattern matching
% (especially or-patterns) is a murky subject. Haskell has pattern guards and side
% conditions, but no or-patterns. OCaml has side conditions and or-patterns, but
% no guards. Mixing all three is (according to some readings) simply difficult for
% implementers- including, interestingly, those of parsers. In Verse, having `one`
% and `choice` closely tied in with the simple `e1 = e2` equation form, which by
% itself subsumes pattern matching, side-conditions, and pattern guards, means
% that integrating options is easy. A key theme that arises of this: Verse has
% fewer constructs, and they are more expressive.
