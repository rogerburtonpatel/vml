\begin{abstract}
Pattern matching appeals to functional programmers for its expressiveness and
good cost model via compilation to a decision tree, but certain computations can
only be expressed verbosely using pattern matching primitives. The problem can
be solved by extensions, but these are not standardized, and no single popular
programming language contains all the extensions to pattern matching. By
contrast, equations in Verse are both expressive and succinct, with no obvious
need for extensions; however, Verse's cost model is a challenge. To resolve
these problems, I propose a new language, \VMinus, which uses Verse's equations
with some restrictions. I show that \VMinus subsumes \PPlus, a core language
with three popular extensions to pattern matching. I also show that \VMinus can
be compiled to a decision tree.
