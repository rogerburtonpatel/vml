\section{\VMinus can be compiled to a decision tree}
\label{vminustod}
    To demonstrate that \VMinus has the same desirable cost model as pattern
    matching, I present an algorithm for compiling \VMinus to a decision tree. I
    choose the decision tree as a target for compilation for the simple reason
    of its appealing cost model. A decision tree can be exponential in size but
    never examines a word of the \it{scrutinee}--- the value being tested---
    more than once. It is the compilation from \VMinus to \D that establishes
    this property by ensuring that no \it{test} node \it{T} has any proper
    ancestor \it{T'} such that \it{T} and \it{T'} both test the same location in
    memory.   

    This compilation algorithm serves to demonstrate that \VMinus is a viable
    alternative to pattern matching on the grounds that they have equivalent
    cost models: pattern matching can be compiled to a decision tree,
    which~\citet{macqueen1985tree} built the foundation for and~\citet{maranget}
    expanded on. 

    The algorithm runs during \DTran, the transformation from \VMinus to \D. Its
    domain, instead of a \it{case} expression, is \VMinus's \it{if-fi}. 
       
    \subsection{\D is a generalization of Maranget's trees} 

    % \rab{Do italics on italics cancel out in a cs paper as well? I un-italicized
    % D in this automatically-italicized subsection title; is that right?}

    Decision trees in \D are engineered to look like Maranget's trees. There are
    a few minor differences in the algorithm I use and Maranget's: his
    compilation algorithm is more complex than the one in this paper, and
    involves an intermediate representation of occurrence vectors and clause
    matrices which the algorithm I present does not use. Maragnet uses vectors
    and matrices to express multiple simultaneous matches of values to patterns
    as a single match of a vector with a matrix row. This allows him to run a
    \it{specialization} pass that reduces the number of rows in the matrix,
    ultimately leading to smaller trees. 
        
    The underlying structures of Maranget's and \D's decision trees, however,
    are analogous. The same operation is the heart of their evaluation: they
    take a value, examine it, and choose a branch based on its form (Maranget
    calls the operation \textsc{Switch}; we call it \it{test}). 

    Let's look at an example from \it{Compiling Pattern Matching to Good
    Decision Trees} which shows the structure of a simple pattern-matching
    function and its corresponding decision tree, then at a corresponding tree
    in \D. 

    Maranget beings with the function, \tt{merge}, which merges two lists: 

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{../tex/images/merge.png}
        \Description{Maranget's merge implementation}
        \caption{The skeleton of Maranget's \tt{merge}}
    \end{figure}

    % He then shows an intermediate representation in his compilation algorithm,
    % the occurrence vector and clause matrix: 

    % \begin{figure}[H]
    %     \begin{gather*}
    %         \vec{o} = (\tt{xs ys}) \hspace{3em}
    %         P \rightarrow A = 
    %         \begin{pmatrix}
    %             \tt{[]}     & \tt{\_}     & \rightarrow \tt{xs} \\
    %             \tt{\_}     & \tt{[]}     & \rightarrow \tt{ys} \\
    %             \tt{\_::\_} & \tt{\_::\_} & \rightarrow \tt{...} 
    %         \end{pmatrix}
    %     \end{gather*}


    %     \Description{Occurrence vector of names, and clause matrix of matches}
    %     \caption{The occurrence vector and clause matrix are intermediate
    %     representations in Maranget's compilation. I do not exploit this
    %     representation in my own algorithm, but it helps to understand his final
    %     tree.}
    % \end{figure}

    He compiles the function to this decision tree: 

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{../tex/images/dtree.png}
        \Description{The final decision tree for merge} 
        \caption{The final compiled decision tree for \tt{merge}, right-to-left}
    \end{figure}

    When presented with the values \tt{xs} and \tt{ys}, the tree first tests
    \tt{xs} against its two known possible forms: the nullary list constructor
    \tt{[]}, and the application of the \it{cons} constructor \tt{::}. If
    \tt{xs} is equal to \tt{[]}, the tree immediately returns \tt{ys}. If
    \tt{xs} is an application of \tt{::}, the tree then tests \tt{ys} against
    the same list of possible constructors, and returns a value according to the
    result of the match. Each time the tree goes down a \tt{::} branch, it can
    extract the arguments of the \tt{::} for later use: these are \tt{x},
    \tt{y}, \tt{xr}, and \tt{yr}, which are used in the \tt{...} branch. This
    process of extracting arguments generalizes to all value constructors with
    one or more arguments. 

    Here is the decision tree for \tt{merge} in \D.

        know exactly what this tree looks like.}

    \subsection{Rules (Big-step Operational Semantics) for \D:}
    
    \rab{Here is where the operational semantics for \D will live.}
    % \dsemantics
    \subsection{The \DTran\ algorithm: \VMinus $\rightarrow$ \D}

    When presented with an \it{if-fi}, \DTran\ introduces all the names under
    the all existential $\exists$'s to a context which determines if a name is
    \it{known} or \it{unknown}. At the start, each name introduced by $\exists$
    is \it{unknown}. Since all names are unique at this stage, there are no
    clashes. 


    \rab{I describe the algorithm in plain English here.}

    % \DTran\ then repeatedly chooses a guarded expression $G$ and attempts the
    % following: 

    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item If there are no guards, insert a \it{match} node with the
    %     right-hand side of $G$. 
    %     \item Choose an equation in $G$ of the form $x = K \dots$ s.t. $x$ is
    %     \it{known}. 
    %     \item If one is found, use it to generate a \it{test} node, building
    %     each subtree of the \it{test} by pruning all branches in \it{all}
    %     guarded expressions of the \it{if-fi} in which $x = e$ and $e \neq K
    %     \dots$ and invoking \DTran\ on the remaining ones with a context where
    %     $x$ is known. The algorithm builds the default tree of the \it{test} by
    %     finding it in the \it{if-fi} or assembling one that fails at runtime. 
    %     \item If no equation of the form \it{x = K \dots} is found, try to 
    %     find a condition $e$ s.t. all names in $e$ are known. 
    %     \item If one is found, use it to generate a \it{let}-\it{if-then-else}
    %     pair, pruning each subtree of $e$. 
    %     \item If no condition $e$ is found, try to find an equation $x = e$ s.t.
    %     both $x$ and all names in $e$ are \it{known}.
    %     \item If one is found, generate a \it{let} node, make $x$ known, prune
    %     the \it{if-fi} of all duplicate instances of that $x = e$, and invoke
    %     \DTran\ again. 
    %     \item If none is found, the \it{if-fi} cannot be compiled to a decision
    %     tree. The algorithm halts with an error. 
    % \end{enumerate}

    The algorithm terminates when inserts a final \it{match} node for a
    right-hand side expression $e$ when the list of guards preceding $e$ is
    empty or a list of assignments from names to unbound names. Termination of
    \DTran\ is guaranteed because each recursive call passes a list of guarded
    expressions in which the number of guards is strictly smaller, so eventually
    the algorithm reaches a state in which the first unmatched branch is all
    trivially-satisfied guards. 

    % \DTran\ makes the distinction for an equation \it{x = e}
    % based off of this model: 
    % \begin{enumerate}
    % \item 
    % \end{enumerate}
    % No guards  ==  MATCH
    % CONDITION  ==   if known, convert to LET, IF
    % EQN (x, e) ==
    %    - if x is known and e is VCONAPP, generate TEST
    %    - if x is known and e is not VCONAPP and e is known
    %         generate LET, IF
    %    - if x is unknown and e is known, then generate LET
       
%  What if we don't find any of the above? 
%  There must be only unknown guards. 
%  Can't compile! 
    
    % For an equation that
    % represents a binding of values to values, the algorithm inserts a \it{let}
    % node, and for a condition guard \it{e}, it inserts a \it{let} followed by 
    % an \it{if-then-else}. 
    
    
    
    \rab{Here will live the formal algorithm for \DTran}.

    \subsection{Translation from \VMinus to \D preserves semantics}
    
    Translating \it{if-fi} to a decision tree should preserve semantics. The
    following theorem formalizes this claim:
