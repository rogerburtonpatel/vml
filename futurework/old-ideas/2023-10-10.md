A couple of notes from on my way home:

 1. Let's simplify your life by taking restricting the scrutinee in a `case` expression:
 
    ```
    exp ::= (case ident of {[pattern exp]})
    ```
    
    Treat the original form as syntactic sugar:
    
    ```
    (case e of ⋯) ≜ (let ([x e]) (case x of ⋯)
    ```
    
    where `x` is fresh.
    
 2. The proposal for $V$ won't work: the existential doesn't scope correctly.  Let me suggest a new syntactic category:
 
    ```
    guarded-exp ::= exp
                 |  ∃ x . guarded-exp
                 |  x = exp; guarded-exp
    ```

    Please try using this form to rewrite our notion of `if ⋯ fi`.
